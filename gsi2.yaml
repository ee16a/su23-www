    bio: "Hi everyone! My name is SooHyuk and I am a rising junior studying Computer Science and Data Science from Seoul, South Korea. This is my 3rd semester on the 16A staff team. I'm interested in various fields of EECS--from computer architecture to machine learning! I really enjoyed 16A and its approach to combine linear algebra and circuit knowledge for real-world problems when I took it as a student. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, swimming, and just walking around the campus! Super excited to serve as a tutor for 16A this summer!"
