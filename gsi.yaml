In my free time I enjoy board games, watching an absurd amount of Youtube, and reading books. I love listening to indie, alternative and folk music but I'm always willing to try out new music.

    bio: "Hi! I’m Joyce, I’m a fourth year CS major from Minnesota. My technical interests include signals processing and biotech. Some things I like doing in my free time are hiking, rock climbing, napping, and spontaneously going to Trader Joe's. I've been teaching lab for the past 4 semesters and strongly believe that it's the best part of 16A, so I'm very excited to meet you all in lab!"

    bio: "Hello! My name is Jack, and I'm a rising junior majoring in CS. I'm passionate about building things, with my current technical interests being in signals, communication systems, embedded systems, and applications in art and music. I see computers as being the "glue" that holds together the components of a technological solution to an interesting problem, which is why I chose to study them. I also like to play guitar, make things, and explore the outdoors in my free time. I often tell my students not to "suffer in silence"; please don't hesitate to reach out to me in and outside of lab!"
