In my free time I enjoy board games, watching an absurd amount of Youtube, and reading books. I love listening to indie, alternative and folk music but I'm always willing to try out new music. Feel free to talk to me about anything!"

    bio: "Hi! I’m Joyce, I’m a fourth year CS major from Minnesota. My technical interests include signals processing and biotech. Some things I like doing in my free time are hiking, rock climbing, napping, and spontaneously going to Trader Joe's. I've been teaching lab for the past 4 semesters and strongly believe that it's the best part of 16A, so I'm very excited to meet you all in lab!"
