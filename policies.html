      <h3>Course Info</h3>
      <a class="anchor" id="courseInfo"></a>
        <p>
          The EECS 16AB series (Designing Information Devices and Systems) is a pair of introductory-level courses introducing students to EECS. The courses have a particular emphasis on how to build and understand systems interacting with the world from an informational point of view. Mathematical modeling is an important theme throughout these courses, and students will learn many conceptual tools along the way. These concepts are rooted in specific application domains. Students should understand why they are learning something.
        </p>
        <p>
          An important part of being a successful engineer is being able to identify the important and relevant structure in a complex problem while ignoring minor issues. EECS 16A focuses on modeling as abstraction: how can we see the relevant underlying structure in a problem? It introduces the basics of linear modeling, largely from a "static" and deterministic point of view. EECS 16B deepens the understanding of linear modeling and introduces dynamics and control, along with additional applications. Finally, EECS 70, (which can be thought of as the third course in this sequence --- except without any labs), introduces additional discrete structures for modeling problems, and brings in probability.
        </p>
        <p>
          In EECS 16A in particular, we will use the application domains of imaging and tomography, smartphones and touchscreens, and GPS and localization to motivate and inspire. Along the way, we will learn the basics of linear algebra and, more importantly, the linear-algebraic way of looking at the world. The emphasis will be on modeling and using linear structures to solve problems; the class is not just focused on how to do computations. We will learn about linear circuits, not merely as a powerful and creative way to help connect the physical world to what we can process computationally, but also as an exemplar of linearity and as a vehicle for learning how to do design. Circuits also provide a concrete setting in which to learn the key concept of "equivalence" --- an important aspect of abstraction. Our hope is that the concepts you learn in EECS 16A will help you as you tackle more advanced courses and will help form a solid conceptual framework that will help you learn throughout your career.

    <h3>Grade Breakdown</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="gradeBreak"></a>
    <p>
        Our objective is to help you become the best engineer you can be, and grades are not everything. The various
        components of the class -- homework, labs and exams -- are designed explicitly with this in mind. Every
        challenge is a growth opportunity. You will have the opportunity to gain points in the course through completing
        your homework and attending labs as well as through the exams. We will periodically update <a href="http://status.eecs16a.org">Status Check</a> with your grades throughout the semester so you can keep track of your grades in the course and identify any grading issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        This course is not graded on a curve. We will set absolute thresholds for performance that will map to grade
        boundaries. We encourage you to discuss the course material with each other and teach each other new ideas and
        concepts that you learn. Here is the breakdown for grading for this class:

    <h3>Grading Scale</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="gradeScale"></a>
    <p>
        This course is not curved. As set by the university, you need a C- or better to pass the class if you take the class PNP and a D- or better to pass if you take the course for a letter grade (though please check for policies specific to your major). We define the following grading scale (in percentages):
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped" style="width: 30%">

    <h3>Exam Clobber Policy</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="secondChance"></a>
    <p>
        This course spans a fairly broad set of ideas and concepts within a short period of time, and hence sustained
        and consistent effort and investment are critical to your success in this class.
    </p>
    <p>
        To give students a ‘second chance’, we will provide the opportunity to clobber a midterm to <b>students who
        complete an optional midterm redo. If you do not complete the midterm redo, you will not qualify for the clobber. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        For each midterm, if you complete the midterm redo, we will replace your corresponding midterm score with your scaled final exam score if it would help your grade (this is a "full clobber" of your midterm score with your final score). You are able to clobber both midterms with your final exam score if you complete both midterm redo assignments. We will use the following formula:
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>clobbered midterm score = max(original midterm score, scaled score on final exam)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you score 50% on the first midterm (0.5*55 = 27.5 points) and 80% on the final, then you midterm 1 score will be instead set to 0.8*55 = 44 points (as opposed to getting a 27.5).
    </p>

    <h3>Homework (HW) Party and Office Hours (OH)</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="hwPartyOH"></a>
    <!-- <p> <p> <font color="purple"> <b> 9/30/2020: </b> </font> <b> As OH becomes more popular, we will be implementing a policy where TAs will spend about 10 minutes with each student, and move down the queue after this time (this applies when other students are on the queue). This is to ensure that everyone has a better chance to ask their questions. We are actively observing OH utilization are various time slots and making changes to TA allocations to best accomodate everyone's timing preferences as well. </b> </p>
    <p> <p> <font color="purple"> <b> 9/2/2020: </b> </font> <b> The information below might be slightly out of date as we work on developing the best all-around solution for your learning; for the most recent information concerning OH and (especially) HW Party, including detailed information about how to join and what steps to take, please see <a href="https://piazza.com/class/ke3aj8z75apb0?cid=131">this Piazza Post</a>. </b> </p> -->
    <p>
        Homework parties are your chance to meet and interact with other students, while also having the chance to get
        help from GSIs, tutors, and faculty. We expect students to treat each other with respect during homework parties
        as well as during all other parts of the class, including interactions on <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/32756/discussion/"
                                                                                     target="_blank">Ed</a>, discussion,
        and office hours. Remember that each of you is coming into a class with different experiences and backgrounds --
        use this as an opportunity to learn from one another.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>HW party will be held each Friday from 9-11 AM in Wozniak Lounge (430-438 Soda Hall). Attending
            homework party is highly encouraged and is a great way to find a study group!</b> Students are expected to
        help each other out and collaborate.
        <!-- ; please see <a href="https://piazza.com/class/ke3aj8z75apb0?cid=131">this Piazza Post</a> for details. -->
    </p>
    <p>
        Office Hours will be held almost every day, as annotated on the course Google calendar. You can come to office
        hours with your study groups, or by yourself -- there will be one or more TAs there to help you work through the
        concepts or the homework! All office hours will be held in-person in Cory 144MA. During office hours, please put yourself on the wait queue available here <a href="https://oh.eecs16a.org">oh.eecs16a.org</a> (some TAs may not be using this wait queue if there are not many students present in OH, check in with the TA).
    </p>
    <p>
        All homework parties and office hours will be held in-person, unless otherwise specified on Ed.
    </p>

    <h3>Homework and Self-Grade Submission</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="hwSgSubmission"></a>
    <p>
        To receive any credit for homework, you must follow all of the below steps.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Do the homework.</b></li>
        <li><b>Submit the homework by Friday night at 11:59 PM Pacific Time.</b> You need to turn in a .pdf file
            consisting of your written-up solutions that also includes an attached pdf "printout" of your .ipynb code on
            Gradescope. In addition, Gradescope has an option to associate pages of your work to each homework problem.
            You must select the relevant pages for every problem. <b>Any homework submissions that are turned in without
                the code “printout” (or screenshot) attached will receive a zero on the coded ipython notebook portions
                of the homework. Any problems without pages selected will receive zero credit. </b>If you have any
            questions about the format of a homework submission, please go to office hours or homework party. We will
            provide HW accommodations for students who have letters of accommodations from DSP services indicating extensions on homework assignments.
        </li>
        <li><b>Slip Day Policy + Late Submissions.</b> Students in 16A will have 6 slip days they can use across the entire semester (3 slip days for EECS47D students). Slip days allow you to submit your homework past the Friday deadline on either Saturday by 11:59 PM PT (using 1 slip day) or on Sunday by 11:59 PM PT (using 2 slip days). Note that you may you at most 2 slip days for any homework assignment. You do not need to inform us that you are using your slip days as we will keep track of this internally based on when you submit on Gradescope. We have this slip day policy to account for situations out of your control that prevent you from submitting the homework on time. If you use slip days your assignment will be marked as late on Gradescope, but your grade will not be penalized for using slip days, nor will you benefit from keeping slip days at the end of the semester. Please budget slip days accordingly as no additional slip days will be provided. <b>In no cases will we accept late homework beyond Sunday (beyond 2 slip days) for any reason.</b> If you run out of slip days, please submit what you have completed by Friday night as we will not be able to consider homework submitted late once you run out of slip days. Note that we have homework drops available if you are unable to submit an assignment due to extenuating circumstances (see further below). </li>
        <li><b>Read the solutions.</b> Official solutions will be released the following Monday morning.</li>
        <li><b>Do the self-grade.</b> Grade your submitted work accordingly for every part of every problem in the
            homework on a simple coarse scale as described in the table below. Enter your self-grades into the posted
            self-grade form for that homework, which will generate a .txt file, and upload that .txt file to the
            appropriate self-grade assignment on Gradescope.<br>

                Note: You must justify self-grades of 2, 5 or 8 with a comment. Grades of 0 and 10 do not need to be
                justified (you can just write "Incorrect" or "Correct"). If you are really confused about how to grade a particular problem, you should post on Ed.
                This is not supposed to be a stressful process.

        <li><b>Submit the self-grade by the Friday night following the homework deadline at 11:59 PM Pacific Time.</b>

    <h3>Reader Grades</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="readerGrades"></a>
    <p>Course readers are going to be grading and sending you occasional comments. <b>Your own scores will be used in
        computing your final homework grade for the course, adjusted by taking into account reader scores so that everyone is
        fairly graded effectively on the same scale.</b> For example, if we notice that you tend to give yourself 5s on
        questions where readers looking at your homeworks tend to give you 8s, we will apply an upward correction to
        adjust (and if you consistently inflate your self grade scores we will apply a downward correction to your scores). This correction factor, called the reader adjustment factor, will be visible to you throughout the semester on <a href="http://status.eecs16a.org">Status Check</a>. <b>Any consistent discrepancy between your self-assigned grades and the reader grades will be flagged and checked for academic dishonesty</b>, so please grade yourself appropriately without attempting to
        inflate your grades.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reader grades will be released on Gradescope about one week after the homework deadline. Readers grade questions
        either on a “coarse” or “fine” scale for each homework part. Coarsely graded question parts are graded based on
        effort. Finely graded question parts are worth a total of 10 points and are graded using the same self-grading
        rubric above. Homework regrade requests are typically due on Gradescope within 72 hours of reader grades being
        released. If a regrade request is submitted for a part of a question on the homework, the grader reserves the
        right to regrade the entire homework and could potentially take points off.

<!--    <h3>Homework Resubmission</h3>-->
<!--    <a class="anchor" id="hwResubmission"></a>-->
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        The point of homework in this class is to help you learn. We understand that sometimes work from other classes,-->
<!--        midterms or your personal life can come in the way of making a homework deadline. For this reason we will allow-->
<!--        you to resubmit your homework for 70% credit. <b> Homework resubmissions (apart from iPython code) must be-->
<!--        HANDWRITTEN. Homework resubmissions will be due along with the self-grades, so they will be due by 11:59pm-->
<!--        Monday night. If you choose to resubmit your homework, you must submit two sets of self-grades, one for the-->
<!--        first submission and one for the second submission. For the second submission, do self-grades as normal. We will-->
<!--        apply the 70% correction. </b>-->
<!--    </p>-->
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        What does 70% credit mean? Let us say you only were able to get halfway through a problem during the first-->
<!--        submission. You submitted your homework on Friday, and while going through the solutions you figured out how to-->
<!--        do the whole problem. Your self-grade for your first submission would be a 5/10. However, you can resubmit the-->
<!--        homework problem with a fully correct solution and receive 70% of the remaining points as extra points, i.e.-->
<!--        (10-5) * 70/100 = 3.5 extra points, and so your score for the problem would go from 5 points to 8.5 points.-->
<!--    </p>-->

    <h3>Homework Effort Policy</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="hwEffort"></a>
    <p>
        Because the point of homework in this class is again to help you learn, not to punish you for making small
        mistakes,
        if your final score (after applying any corrections due to the reader adjustment factor) on any homework is above 8/10,
        your grade will automatically be bumped up to 100% (10/10). If your final score is less than 8/10, it will be
        scaled accordingly. For example 6/10 will result in 75% (7.5/10).
    </p>


    <h3>Homework Scoring</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="hwScoring"></a>
    <p>
        The following formula summarizes how homework scores are calculated:
    </p>
    <img src="img/selfgrade_formula.PNG" width="700" style="margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;">

    <p>
        <b>We will automatically drop your lowest two homework scores (only 1 homework drop for EECS47D students) from your final grade calculation.</b> These drop are meant for emergencies in which you are not able to submit a homework. If you have already used both of your homework drops we will not be able to provide any further drops for any reason.
    </p>
    </a>

    <h3>Participation in Discussion</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="participation"></a>
    <p>
        Discussion is a key component to learning the material in this class. Every week, discussion will be held on Monday
        and Wednesday. Different material will be covered on Monday and Wednesday, so you are encouraged to attend on
        both days. You may choose to attend any discussion section on a given day, and are encouraged to try out several
        different TAs’ discussion sections to find which one works best for you. All discussions will take place in person and material covered on discussion worksheets is in scope for the exams.
    </p>
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        Participation is worth a maximum of 10 points. This is measured by discussion attendance. For each discussion-->
<!--        section that you attend, you will fill out an attendance form to count your participation. You must attend 16-->
<!--        discussion sections to get full participation points. Please note that this number is the minimum required for-->
<!--        full credit, but you are highly encouraged to attend more discussions.-->
<!--    </p>-->
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        If you do not get full credit, your grade will be calculated by the number of discussion checkoffs you complete;-->
<!--        e.g., if you attend (watch) 14 discussions or complete 14 checkoffs, you will have 14/16 * 10 = 8.7 points in-->
<!--        this category.-->
<!--    </p>-->
    <p>
        Discussion attendance is not part of your course grade, but we highly encourage you to attend sections as it's a great opportunity to learn and solidify course material is a smaller classroom setting.
    </p>


    <h3>Lab Policies</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="labDiscussion"></a>
    <p>
        Labs this semester will be held in-person, except where otherwise stated on Ed. Labs for this class are not open
        section, <b>you must go to your assigned lab section</b>. Lab assignments will be determined at the start of the semester.
    </p>
    <p>
        Credit for each lab is based on completion and checkoff with a member of lab staff during your assigned lab
        section. In a checkoff, you will demonstrate your work from portions of the lab and answer conceptual questions
        related to the lab. You should aim to get checked off by the end of your lab section. If (and only if) you
        attend your lab section for the whole duration but do not finish in time, you may get checked off at the
        beginning of your next lab section before starting the following lab. We have the following grading policy for
        labs: If you complete all the labs, you will receive full lab credit. If you fail to complete one lab, you will
        receive almost full 54/55 lab credit. If you miss two labs, you will receive 52/55. If you miss three labs, you
        will receive 28/55 (half credit). If you miss four or more labs, you will get an F in the class.

        <b>Some lab sections are “buffer labs”.</b> These are held during a week-long period at the end of each lab
        module in which no new labs begin.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may get checked off for <b> only one missed lab per lab module</b> by attending a buffer lab for that
        module. No other labs can be checked off. If you have already completed all labs for a particular lab module,
        you do not need to attend a buffer lab for that module.
    </p>
    <p>
        Students must sign up for a buffer lab before attending. Please note that not all regularly scheduled lab
        sections will be run as buffer lab sections. Further details will be shared duly on Ed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Wires on lab breadboards must be planar.</b> All students will receive a lab kit to use during lab sections.
        Lab staff will ask students to redo their circuits before debugging them if the wires are non-planar. The
        definition of planar wires on a breadboard is shown below:

    <h3>Exam Policies</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="exampolicy"></a>
    <p> <b> There are two midterms and one final. All exams will be held in-person. The midterms will be held on Wednesday, March 1st from 7:00pm to 9:00pm and Monday, April 17th from 7:00pm to 9:00pm (NOTE: these midterm dates are not yet finalized by the department and are subject to change. We will keep everyone posted once we have finalized midterm dates). The final will be held on Monday, May 8th from 11:30am to 2:30pm. </b> </p>
    <p><b>Makeup midterms and final exams will not be scheduled and there will be no alternate exam times. Please contact us privately if you have any concerns.</b></p>
    <p>
        In case of an emergency on exam day, please email the Head GSI at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
                                                                             href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a>
        as soon as possible and provide details of your situation. Emergency exam conflicts
        will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Exam conflicts originating from a lecture conflict will not be
        accommodated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regrade requests are open for a few days after exam scores are released. Late regrade requests will not be
        considered for any reason. If a regrade request is submitted for a part of a question on the exam, the grader reserves the
        right to regrade the entire exam and could potentially take points off.
    </p>
    <p>
        Exams will be completely open-note and open-book – you are allowed to bring any hard-copy resources with you to
        help you on the exam. However, while you can bring other materials with you to the exam, you are strongly
        encouraged to make a condensed cheat sheet of only one or two pages ahead of the exam, as the process of
        creating a cheat sheet can be a great way to study for an exam. No calculators, smartwatches, or other electronics will be allowed during the exam.
    </p>

    <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
    <p>
        We treat all our students with utmost trust and respect, and expect students to return the same trust and
        respect. In EECS16A we will have <u>zero-tolerance</u> for academic dishonesty. There will be <u>dire
        consequences</u> for students that violate that trust and the Berkeley code of conduct. Both professors Waller
        and Muller are committed to enforcing academic honesty, and <u>dishonesty cases will be punished in their
        fullest -- no excuses or special circumstances will be considered</u>. Always seek help, never cheat.
    </p>

    <h3>Exceptions and Exam Accommodations</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="exceptions"></a>
    <p>
        <b>Any requests for exceptions should be emailed to the Head GSI at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
                                                                               href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a>.</b>
        Email the exception request as soon as possible (before any deadline), as retroactive exceptions will likely not be approved.
        Exceptions will be handled on a case-by-case basis. <b>Since there are two homework drops and a slip day policy, homework extension requests will almost certainly not be approved.</b> Examples of situations that merit an exception are medical emergencies and family emergencies. It will be easier for us to grant an exception if you have a doctor’s note or other documentation, so please send those along with your exception request. No exceptions will be granted after final exam scores have been released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Accommodations will be provided to students who have letters of accommodations from DSP services and students
        facing hardships. Student hardships may include family/medical emergencies (please provide documentation for
        your records). Please contact the Head GSI at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
                                                                     href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a>.

    <!--     <p>
          If you can foresee unstable or limited WiFi access to an upcoming exam, contact <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a> to determine a procedure that will support you. Additionally, if your WiFi access is disrupted or fails during the exam, contact <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a> as soon as possible for an alternative arrangement.
        </p> -->

    <h3>Course Communication</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="communication"></a>
    <p>
        <b>The instructors and TAs will post announcements, clarifications, corrections, etc. on Ed.</b> So, you must check
        the EECS16A Ed page frequently throughout the term. (You should already have access to the EECS16A Spring 2023 <a
            href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/32756/discussion/" target="_blank">Ed</a>. If you do not, please let us know.)
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a question, your best option is to post a message on Ed. The staff (instructors and TAs) will check
        Ed regularly, and if you use Ed, other students will be able to help you too. When using Ed, please avoid
        off-topic discussions, and please do not post answers to homework questions before the homework is due. Also,
        always look for a convenient category to post the question to (for example, each homework will have its own
        category, so please post there). That will ensure you get the answer faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your question is personal or not of interest to other students, we encourage you to email us (see the top of this page for all the course emails) rather than making private Ed posts. If you wish to talk with one of us individually, you are welcome to come to our office hours. Please reserve email for the questions you can't get answered in office hours, in discussion sections, or through Ed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>For any exceptions that are of a personal nature</b>, please contact the head GSI at <a
            rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a>.
        Technical and homework questions are best resolved in homework party, Ed, and during office hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can be challenging for the instructors to gauge how smoothly the class is going. We always welcome any
        feedback on what we could be doing better.
    </p>

    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="collaboration"></a>
    <p>
        We encourage you to work on homework problems in study groups; however, you must always write up the solutions
        on your own. Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you must
        always credit all such sources in your write up, and you must never copy material verbatim. <b>Using previous
        EECS 16A homework, exam, and lab solutions is strictly prohibited, and will be considered academic dishonesty.
        This is not how you want to start your career as an engineer.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        We expect that most students can distinguish between helping other students and cheating. Explaining the meaning
        of a question, discussing a way of approaching a solution, or collaboratively exploring how to solve a problem
        within your group is an interaction that we strongly encourage. But you should write your homework solution
        strictly by yourself, and you are not allowed to give your homework to other students to copy. You should never
        possess a copy (written or digital) of another student’s work. You should acknowledge everyone whom you have
        worked with, or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework. <b>This is good scholarly
        conduct.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Collaboration during exams or other designated assessments is strictly forbidden, subject to the <a
            href="https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code" target="_blank">Berkeley Honor Code</a>, <a
            href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/faculty-staff/violations" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a>, and the
        parameters of the specific assessment.
    </p>

    <h3>16A Study Group Formation</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="studyGroups"></a>
    <p>
        To help encourage collaboration and make it easier to meet new people in the class, we have designed a system
        for study-group formation where you can request study partners just by submitting a simple Google preference
        survey. This survey is part of the first homework, and while optional, we highly encourage you to fill it out,
        because having people to brainstorm with on homework can be very helpful and improve your learning.
    </p>

    <h3>Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="help"></a>
    <p>
        Are you struggling? Please come talk with us! The earlier we learn about your struggles, the more likely it is
        that we can help you. Waiting until right before an exam or the last few weeks of the semester to let us know
        about your problems is not an effective strategy - the later it is, the less we will be able to help you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if you are convinced that you are the only person in the class who is struggling, please overcome any
        feelings of embarrassment or guilt, and come ask for help as soon as you need it -- we can almost guarantee
        you're not the only person who feels this way. Don't hesitate to ask us for help -- we really do care that you
        thrive! You can email <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="mailto:eecs16a@berkeley.edu">eecs16a@berkeley.edu</a>,
        or email / talk to any TA at any time -- we’re happy to help.
    </p>

    <h3>Health</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="health"></a>
    <p>
        If you have COVID symptoms, please do not attend in-person activities. Instead, keep up with the class by
        watching the lecture recordings. We will post PDFs of each discussion worksheet on the course website, and post
        detailed solutions the next day, so you can follow along with discussion asynchronously. If you miss a lab section, you should
        try to make up the lab during buffer week. However, if you would miss multiple labs or miss the buffer section
        due to illness, please email eecs16a.lab@berkeley.edu, and we will do our best to accommodate you. If you have contagious symptoms or COVID please do not attend the exam in person and reach out to us well ahead of the exam time (we will handle these situations on a case-by-case basis).
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a medical emergency that would prevent you from keeping up with the class asynchronously or would
        prevent you from attending class in-person for a longer duration, please email eecs16a@berkeley.edu.
    </p>

    <h3>Inclusion</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="inclusion"></a>
    <p>
        We are committed to creating an environment welcoming of all students where everyone can fulfill their potential
        for learning. To do so, we intend to support a diversity of perspectives and experiences and respect each
        others’ identities and backgrounds (including race/ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class,
        sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, etc.). To help accomplish this:
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by a lack of inclusion, please contact the
            instructors, an academic advisor, or the departmental Faculty Equity Advisor
            (https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion/faculty-equity-advisers/).
        </li>
        <li>
            An anonymous feedback form is also available at <a
                href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion/feedback/" target="_blank">https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion/feedback/</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class (e.g.,
            family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with the instructor(s) or academic
            advisors in Engineering Student Services. We want to be a resource for you.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no tolerance for sexual harassment or violence. If your behavior harms another person in this
            class, you may be removed from the class or the University either temporarily or permanently.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have a name and/or pronouns that differ from your legal name, designate a preferred name for use in
            the classroom at: <a href="https://registrar.berkeley.edu/academic-records/your-name-records-rosters"
                                 target="_blank">https://registrar.berkeley.edu/academic-records/your-name-records-rosters</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            As a participant in this class, recognize that you can be proactive about making other students feel
            included and respected.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Berkeley Honor Code</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="honor"></a>
    <p>
        Everyone in this class is expected to adhere to this code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with
        honesty, integrity, and respect for others.”
    </p>

    <h3>Accommodation policy</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="accomodation"></a>
    <p> We honor and respect the different learning needs of our students, and are committed to ensuring you have the
        resources you need to succeed in our class. If you need religious or disability-related accommodations, if you
        have emergency medical information you wish to share with us, please share this information with us as needed.
        You may write to the course email address <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"

    <h3>Advice</h3>
    <a class="anchor" id="advice"></a>
    <p>
        The following tips are offered based on our experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Do the homeworks!</b> The homework is explicitly designed to help you to learn the material as you go along.
        There is usually a strong correlation between homework scores and final grades in the class.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Keep up with lectures!</b> Discussion sections, labs and homeworks all touch on portions of what we discuss
        in lecture. <b>Students do much better if they stay on track with the course.</b> That will also help you keep
        the pace with your homework and study group.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Take part in discussion sections!</b> Discussion sections are not auxiliary lectures. They are an opportunity
        for interactive learning. The success of a discussion section depends largely on the willingness of students to
        participate actively in it. As with office hours, the better prepared you are for the discussion, the more you
        are likely to benefit from it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Please come to office hours!</b> We love to talk to you and do a deep dive to help you understand the
        material better.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Form study groups!</b> As stated above, you are encouraged to form small groups (two to four people) to work
        together on homeworks and on understanding the class material on a regular basis. In addition to being fun, this
        can save you a lot of time by generating ideas quickly and preventing you from getting hung up on some point or
        other. Of course, it is your responsibility to ensure that you contribute actively to the group; passive
        listening will likely not help you much. And recall the caveat above that you must write up your solutions on
        your own. We strongly advise you to spend some time on your own thinking about each problem before you meet with
        your study partners; this way, you will be in a position to compare ideas with your partners, and it will get
        you in practice for the exams. Make sure you work through all problems yourself, and that your final write-up is
        your own. Some groups try to split up the problems ("you do Problem 1, I'll do Problem 2, then we'll swap
        notes"); not only is this a punishable violation of our collaboration policies, it also ensures you will learn a
        lot less from this course.
